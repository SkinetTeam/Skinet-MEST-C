# Using the Inference Notebook

An inference notebook is available in the root directory of the repository. You can run it locally or through Google Colaboratory without any major modifications of the script.

## 1. Requirements
At that time, you will at least need the following resources to run the inference notebook : 
* The weights file(s) (a weights file is a folder containing an `assets`, `variables` folder and a `saved_model.pb` file, they might be zipped so you need to unzip it) in the same folder as the different tools.  Those weight files (cortex, mest_main and mest_glom) can be uploaded from the realease section of this repo. You need to get the 3 weight files to be able to have a full evaluation: 
cortex = "skinet_cortex"
mest_main = "skinet_mest_main"
mest_glom = "skinet_mest_glom"
* At least one image to start an inference, it should be placed in a directory named `images` in a subdirectory named as the inference mode you want to use with it (for example, a subdirectory named `main`). We recommand that you use the inference mode named "main" to start.

  To get performance metrics for an image, you will also need an annotations file (see [Supported formats](Annotations-format-compatibility.md#supported-formats)) having the same name as the image in the same folder.

### Google Colaboratory specific requirements
You will find specific requirements for Google Colaboratory in the [Using the Inference Notebook with Google Colaboratory](Using-the-Inference-Notebook-with-Google-Colaboratory.md#specific-requirements) page.

### Local usage requirements
You will need the Python environment installed (see [Installation Guide](Installation-Guide.md)).

## 2. Configuration of the notebook
### Working with Google Colaboratory
You will find the specific configuration explanation for Google Colaboratory in the [Using the Inference Notebook with Google Colaboratory](Using-the-Inference-Notebook-with-Google-Colaboratory.md#configuration-of-the-notebook) page.


### Working Locally
Simply start Jupyter via the shortcut created during the [Installation Guide](Installation-Guide.md) or by starting an Anaconda (or Miniconda) prompt, navigating to the repository folder using `cd` command, activating the environment via `conda activate Skinet`, and finally by starting Jupyter using `jupyter notebook`.


### Common configuration
#### 'Configuration' cell
```Python
mode = 'chain'
displayMode = "All steps" #@param ["All steps", "Only statistics"]

forceFullSizeMasks = False  #@param {type:"boolean"}
forceLowMemoryUsage = False  #@param {type:"boolean"}
saveResults = True #@param {type:"boolean"}
saveDebugImages = False #@param {type:"boolean"}

moveAutoCleanedImageToNextMode = True #@param {type:"boolean"}
```

These parameters will control which mode the Inference Tool will run and how much text will be displayed.


* `mode`: The name of the inference mode to use. Note that 'chain' will use multiple modes and is the prefered mode. 
* `displayMode`: Whether to display every step (`"All steps"`) of an inference, or only statistics (`"Only statistics"`). 



Next parameters are booleans variables so they can take `True` or `False` as value:


* `forceFullSizeMasks`: Whether to force usage of full-sized masks instead of mini-masks.

* `forceLowMemoryUsage`: Force low-memory mode to use the least RAM as possible.

* `saveResults`: Whether to save the results or not.

* `saveDebugImages`: Whether to save debug images between post-processing methods.

    


* `moveAutoCleanedImageToNextMode`: Whether to move automatically cleaned image image into next mode input folder.
